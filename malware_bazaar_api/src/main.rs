//! # Malware Bazaar API Binary
//!
//! This is the main binary entry point for the Malware Bazaar API client library.
//! It serves as a placeholder for future CLI functionality or example usage.
//!
//! ## Current State
//!
//! The binary currently does nothing but successfully execute. Future versions
//! could provide command-line tools for querying the Malware Bazaar API directly.

use malware_bazaar_api::error;

/// Main entry point for the Malware Bazaar API binary.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` on successful execution, or an [`error::Error`] on failure.
///
/// # Example
///
/// In the future, this could be extended to:
/// - Accept command-line arguments for API queries
/// - Perform hash lookups from the command line
/// - Display formatted results
/// - Export data to various formats
fn main() -> Result<(), error::Error> {
    Ok(())
}
